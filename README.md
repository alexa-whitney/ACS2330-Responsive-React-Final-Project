# The Beguiling Bookshelf - Book Recommendation React Website

This is a book recommendation website built with React and specifically altered to be responsive (with a mobile first approach), and accessible. The site allows users to search for books by title or author, view book information and recommendations, and had a "random book" feature which will populate the book details for a random book in the library.

The project was built with React, utilizing components and state management to provide a seamless and dynamic user interface for a more intuitive experience.
